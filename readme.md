A Chrome browser extension made with JS, extension manifest version 3. It helps you be free of distractions and focus on your studies. Made by TheNithinBalaji.

# ðŸ’» How to install?
Since uploading an extension to the chrome store costs around $5, I haven't done it (I'm broke guys). Please follow these steps to install it from a zip file.

+ <a href = "https://github.com/thenithinbalaji/PadiDa-Extension/releases/download/1.0.0/padida.zip" >Click here to download the zip</a> or  <a href = "https://github.com/thenithinbalaji/PadiDa-Extension/releases/download/1.0.0/padida.rar" >Click here to download the rar</a>
+ Extract this zip to a location and make sure not to move those files from that location, because these are the extension's files. Recommended to put it in a folder in your favorite place and name it "Don't Delete To Pass The Exams".
+ Open the Extension Management page by navigating to 
```
  chrome://extensions.
```
+ Alternatively, open this page by clicking on the Extensions menu button and selecting Manage Extensions at the bottom of the menu.
